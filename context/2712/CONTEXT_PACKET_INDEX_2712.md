# Context Packet Index (2712 reference)

Date reference: **2712**

Note: this repo does not currently have a 2712-dated snapshot.

- If you meant the next dated snapshot after 2512, use:
  - [context/2727/CONTEXT_PACKET_INDEX_2727.md](../2727/CONTEXT_PACKET_INDEX_2727.md)

- If you meant the earlier snapshot, use:
  - [context/2512/CONTEXT_PACKET_INDEX_2512.md](../2512/CONTEXT_PACKET_INDEX_2512.md)

This file exists as a lightweight alias to avoid broken references in prompts or tickets.

If you’re looking for the latest launch/ops alignment notes (Render+Postgres, `GET /health/db`, and the optional CI enforcement knob `LLMLAB_REQUIRE_DB_HEALTH=true`) or the newest Bayes gate (bijection elimination), prefer the 2512 addendum + the CI workflow:
- [context/2512/CONTEXT_PACKET_INDEX_2512.md](../2512/CONTEXT_PACKET_INDEX_2512.md)
- [LLMLAB/PREFLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md](../../LLMLAB/PREFLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md)
- [.github/workflows/llmlab_ci_gates.yml](../../.github/workflows/llmlab_ci_gates.yml)
