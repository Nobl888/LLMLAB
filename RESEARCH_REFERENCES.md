# References (Tracking)

This file is a single source of truth for two different kinds of references:

1) **Internal reference snapshots** (the repo’s dated “context packet” scheme like `2512`).
2) **External research papers** (e.g., arXiv IDs) that motivated the Bayes wind-tunnel direction.

## 1) Internal reference snapshots

- **Ref 2512** — baseline reference snapshot (see `context/2512/` and `LLMLAB/context/2512/`).
- **Ref 2727** — addendum / what changed since 2512 (see `context/2727/` and `LLMLAB/context/2727/`).

## 1b) Active R&D docs (living)

- `LLMLAB/RESEARCH_RND_NEXT_DIRECT_TESTS.md` — OOD-shift sensitivity + temperature/family topology next tests

## 2) External research (paper IDs)

- **arXiv:2512._____** — (optional) fill exact paper ID
- **arXiv:2727._____** — (optional) fill exact paper ID

## Notes

- Keep the lists intentionally short (2–5 items).
- If you cite papers publicly, keep claims modest (“motivated by…”, “inspired by…”) rather than “proves”.
